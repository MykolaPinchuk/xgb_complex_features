## What I did

- Addressed the concern that Levels 4 and 5 may not reflect increasing compositional complexity.
- Wrote a short note clarifying that both are quadratic interactions in log-space, and that the empirical differences arise from invariance-group mixing and distributional geometry rather than polynomial degree.

## Files changed

- Added `paper_draft/2025-12-14_110315/writedown_level_framing_update.md`.
