## Key Steps
1. Created `paper_draft/2025-12-14_110315/` scaffold with a `figures/` subdir for a paper handoff bundle.
2. Re-aggregated `runs/exp_all_levels_10k` with the current aggregator to include variance stats + diagnostics, regenerated its report/plots, and copied plots from all runs into `paper_draft/2025-12-14_110315/figures/` with unique filenames.
3. Generated `paper_draft/2025-12-14_110315/tables.md` containing the full experiment manifest plus per-experiment summary tables, diagnostics summaries, and top/bottom Δ run lists.
4. Wrote `paper_draft/2025-12-14_110315/plots.md` (embedded figures + captions) and `paper_draft/2025-12-14_110315/writedown.md` (narrative summary + key results + limitations/next steps).
