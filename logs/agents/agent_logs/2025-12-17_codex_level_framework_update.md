# Agent log: level framework update

## What I did

- Updated the paper handoff draft to clarify that the current `level` field is a motif taxonomy, not a strict complexity ordering.
- Added a proposed “from scratch” complexity framework that separates signal-form levels from orthogonal invariance and aggregation tags.
- Updated wording in the main-results section to avoid implying that higher `level` always means higher compositional complexity.

## Files changed

- Updated `paper_draft/2025-12-14_110315/writedown.md`.
