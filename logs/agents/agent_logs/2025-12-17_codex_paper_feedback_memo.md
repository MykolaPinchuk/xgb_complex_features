# Agent log: paper feedback memo

- Agent: Codex CLI
- Model: GPT-5.2

## What I did

- Read `paper_draft/2025-12-14_110315/xgb_invariant_features_updated_v2_dec16.pdf` via `pdftotext` to identify claims, task definitions, and framing.
- Drafted a feedback memo for the paper-writing agent that:
  - flags paper-vs-code mismatches in task definitions (notably Levels 3–5),
  - recommends reframing “levels” as motif labels (not a strict complexity ordering),
  - explains why distribution shift is central to the feature-engineering / invariance claim,
  - suggests practitioner-oriented motivation and clearer statement of what the benchmark measures.

## Files changed

- Added `paper_draft/2025-12-14_110315/feedback_to_paper_writing_agent.md`.
