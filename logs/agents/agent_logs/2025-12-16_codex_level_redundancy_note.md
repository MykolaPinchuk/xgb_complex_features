## What I did

- Interpreted the user question as a request to justify keeping the current “level” task definitions despite algebraic similarities.
- Wrote a short, paper-ready note explaining why algebraic similarity in log-space does not imply redundancy under correlated, heavy-tailed raw features and finite-capacity tree learners.

## Files changed

- Added `paper_draft/2025-12-14_110315/writedown_level_redundancy_note.md`.
