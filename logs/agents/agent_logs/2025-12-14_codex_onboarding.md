## Key Steps
1. Reviewed `README.md`, `prd.md`, and `agents.md` to understand the benchmark goals plus repo-specific process expectations.
2. Inspected the CLI entrypoint, runner, dataset/DGP builders, diagnostics, aggregation, and reporting modules to capture how configs flow through run → aggregate → report.
3. Examined the smoke config and Makefile helpers to note default experiment settings, oracle modes, and how workflows are invoked.
