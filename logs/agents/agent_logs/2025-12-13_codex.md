# Agent Run Log
- Agent: Codex (GPT-5)
- Start: 2025-12-13T12:32:01-08:00
- End: 2025-12-13T12:32:08-08:00

## Key Steps
1. Read README, PRD, and agents instructions to understand benchmark goals and process.
2. Inspected source tree (runner, DGP, diagnostics, reporting) to map experiment flow end-to-end.
3. Reviewed configs (smoke/default) plus TODO list to capture current capabilities and planned work.

## Iteration 2
- Agent: Codex (GPT-5)
- Start: 2025-12-13T12:32:08-08:00
- End: 2025-12-13T12:38:24-08:00

## Key Steps
1. Pinned runtime dependencies, documented install/prevalence guidance in README, and added Makefile shortcuts plus the new `workflow` CLI.
2. Enhanced aggregation/report generation with variance stats, per-level diagnostics, ranking tables, and new heatmap/scatter visualizations; updated plots module.
3. Expanded configs with multi-capacity XGB grids + extra seeds, ran the smoke workflow end-to-end to validate the changes, and suppressed tight_layout warnings.

## Iteration 3
- Agent: Codex (GPT-5)
- Start: 2025-12-13T12:38:24-08:00
- End: 2025-12-13T12:46:47-08:00

## Key Steps
1. Attempted to run the full exp_default workflow but it exceeds the allowed execution window (216 specs at n=30k); run was halted after 2 minutes per policy.
2. Added relative Δ% tables (oracle vs raw) to the report’s main summary sections and regenerated the smoke report to validate output.
3. Suppressed remaining tight_layout warnings by removing redundant calls in the new heatmap plot helper.
