# Framing update: Levels 4 and 5

Levels 4 and 5 should not be presented as “deeper compositional complexity” relative to each other. In the current task suite, both levels generate the signal as a product of two coordinates, $s = u_1 u_2$ (`ratio_x_ratio`, `product_x_product`, `ratio_x_product`). If $x$ is lognormal and one writes $z_i=\log x_i$ and ignores stabilizers, each coordinate is approximately a linear form in $z$. Then $s$ is a quadratic form in $z$ for both Level 4 and Level 5. The difference between the levels is therefore not the polynomial degree or “depth of composition”.

The intended scientific distinction is that these tasks probe the same interaction primitive under different invariance groups and correlation geometry. Ratio coordinates are approximately differences in log space, and product coordinates are approximately sums. Mixing them changes the induced distribution of $(u_1,u_2)$ under the regime panel, and it changes which shortcut rules are available to axis-aligned trees trained on raw, heavy-tailed $x$. This is why Levels 4 and 5 can produce materially different gaps in practice even though they share the same abstract interaction form.

Suggested wording for the paper: treat Levels 4 and 5 as a single “interaction” family with subtypes, and describe Level 5 as a hybrid interaction that mixes ratio and product invariances rather than as a strictly higher complexity level. If the paper keeps the numbering, add one sentence clarifying that the level index is a taxonomy of motifs, not a formal ordering by function-class complexity.
